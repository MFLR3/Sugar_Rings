# Sugar_Rings Responsive Website

## A Website developed to meet specifications set by a brief, implemented with responsive web design.

This is a Website coded for an independent textile artist. 
Everything has been coded by me in basic HTML and CSS, for the purposes of gaining a deeper understanding of responsive web design and experience of coding from scratch.
The graphical design and layout of the website was achieved through the application of wireframing using the Figma web application.

## Take a look at the Sugar_Rings wireframes.
